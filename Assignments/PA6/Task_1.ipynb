        "*** Comparison explanation:\n",
        "1. please accept these figures. After testing sequence length 5,12 and 17, google colab disconnected and sequence length 25 was trained separately. This caused graphs to be on different plots\n",
        "2. The training time increased as the sequence length increased. For sequence length of 5, training time was 35 minutes for a million epochs. This increased to about 1 hour and 15 minutes for sequence length 25 for the same number of epochs.\n",
        "3. Seasonality or short term trend is observable for each sequence length. The seasonality is that the loss curve starts to decrease, but after some epochs rises up and then decreases to a greater value, gradually causing the overall trend to be a decreasing loss and a slow rate.\n",
        "4. As sequence length increases, the loss curves settle down to a value that it higher. This implies that the lower sequence length creates english sentenses that more accurately represent the sentences found in the novel.\n",
        "5. Lower loss for the lower sequence hints to the fact that the lower sequence model learned some small characters or words that math the words in the novel. These words were also being repeately shown in the output. This shows that overfitting occured."

        "1. The training time increased as the sequence length increased. This is similar to when the RNN was being trained for novel and golang.\n",
        "2. Seasonality of zig zag pattern is observed. Overall there is a decreasing pattern.\n",
        "3. Loss curve of lower sequence number goes to a lower value than higher value sequence numbers. However, by inspection, higher sequence number gives better roman urdu representation."
